Summary: There are blink javascript files for 2 and 3 layer examples. These
    assume no alpha (transparency) in any of the layers. As such each layer
    is turned off and a new layer loaded when the image is clicked.

Usage: Edit one of the HTML files, substituting your files for the example
    layer PNG files. You will also want to edit the <title> or any generic
    <p> text as necessary. 

Submission: To submit the interactive figure: (a) create a ZIP of the main
    HTML file and the individual layer figure files; (b) upload the
    interactive figure to the AAS Journals submission site; (c) tag the
    package as an interactive figure file; (d) include submission notes. If
    you wish the reviewer to see the interactive figure then let us know and
    we can host it for you (better than your hosting a file for a reviewer.)
    
AASTeX: Create a figure file for the "static" version of the figure (what
    appears in the article PDF were your submission accepted) and include it
    in your manuscript file with the \begin{interactive} figure environment.
    See the Graphics and/or AASTeX guides on https://journals.aas.org/ for
    more details.
