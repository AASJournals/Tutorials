## Goal

The 3D plot was made using the R library "plotly" as documented in https://plot.ly/r/reference/. More information on CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotly/index.html

The exporting to HTML/JS files was done using the [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) R package, which is automatically imported by "plotly."
