AAS Journals encourage authors to use persistent repositories to archive and cite data and software related to submitted manuscripts. "[Using Repositories][6d319412]" and "[Citing Repositories][d8435960]" are two draft tutorials we have created to help authors use repositories for archiving and citing such materials. The "[Using...][6d319412]" tutorial also provides a comparison of data/software repositories for the AAS author to consider. 

These are drafts, so please consult the AAS Journal [Data Editors](mailto:data-editors@aas.org) as you use these instructions for your manuscript. You may also provide direct revisions (pull requests) or report errors (issues) through Github.
